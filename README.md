# NextJS Typescript Starter

Welcome to this NextJS Typescript Starter repository! This project is a powerful starting point for building web applications using NextJS with Typescript. It includes essential tools like ESLint, Airbnb's code style guide, Conventional Commits, Husky, Semantic Release, TailwindCSS for styling, Dependabot for dependencies management, and VSCode settings for a consistent development environment.

## Getting Started

To begin using this starter project, it is recommended to use Node Version Manager (NVM) for managing Node.js versions. The supported Node.js version is specified in the `.nvmrc` file.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have installed:

- NVM (Node Version Manager)
- Node.js (version `20.8.1` or later, managed via NVM)
- npm (usually bundled with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

2. **Install and use the correct Node.js version with NVM**

   ```bash
   nvm install
   nvm use
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Interactively Update Packages

To keep your packages up-to-date interactively, use the `npm-upgrade` tool. This tool allows you to update your `package.json` dependencies interactively.

1. **Run the npm-upgrade command**

   ```bash
   npx npm-upgrade
   ```

2. **Choose the packages to update**

   - `npm-upgrade` will check for updates and present you with a list of packages.
   - You can go through each package and decide whether to update it or not.

3. **Install the updated packages**
   After updating the `package.json`, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   to install the new versions of your packages.

This approach provides more control over package updates compared to automatic updates, ensuring that you review and accept each update individually.

## Initial Repository Setup

For Semantic Release to function correctly, it requires a GitHub token (`GH_TOKEN`) with specific permissions. Follow these steps to set up your repository:

1. **Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**

   - Go to your GitHub settings.
   - Navigate to `Developer settings` > `Personal access tokens`.
   - Click on `Generate new token`.
   - Give your token a name, e.g., `semantic-release-token`.
   - Under scopes, select the following permissions:
     - `repo` (which includes `Contents`, `Issues`, `Pull requests` permissions).
   - Generate the token and copy it.

2. **Add the Token to Your Repository Secrets**

   - Go to your repository on GitHub.
   - Click on `Settings` > `Secrets` > `Actions`.
   - Select `New repository secret`.
   - Name the secret `GH_TOKEN` and paste the token you copied earlier.

3. **Configure Semantic Release**
   - Ensure Semantic Release is configured in your project.
   - It will automatically use the `GH_TOKEN` from your repository secrets.

## GitHub Workflows

This repository contains two main GitHub workflows:

1. **Pull Request Workflow**

   - Triggered on every pull request to the main branch.
   - This workflow runs linting checks and builds the NextJS application.
   - It ensures that the code adheres to the set coding standards and that the application can be successfully built.

2. **Release Workflow**
   - Triggered on every push to the main branch.
   - This workflow runs Semantic Release.
   - It analyzes commit messages to determine the version bump (major, minor, or patch).
   - It then tags the release, updates the CHANGELOG, and publishes the release.

These workflows help in maintaining code quality and in automating the release process, making it easier to manage versioning and changelogs.

## Features

This starter project includes a robust setup with the following features:

- **[NextJS Framework](https://nextjs.org/docs)**: Leveraging the power and simplicity of NextJS for React applications.
- **[Typescript Support](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)**: Strongly-typed language support for improved code quality and developer experience.
- **[ESLint with Airbnb Code Style](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started)**: Enforcing consistent code style and best practices.
- **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)**: Structured commit messages for better version control history.
- **[Husky for Git Hooks](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)**: Automate tasks like linting and tests before commits and pushes.
- **[Semantic Release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/)**: Automated semantic versioning and CHANGELOG generation, patched to use `0.1.0` as the first version.
- **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Dependabot Configuration**: Automated weekly updates for minor and patch versions, categorized into production and development groups. Major version updates are handled separately for better control.
- **VSCode Settings and Recommended Extensions**: Ensures a consistent development environment and recommended tooling for all contributors.
